# Pizza-Calculator

Name: Sawyer Alec Cherry

Project Name: Pizza Calculator

Programming Language Used: Python 3.7.9

Date: 3-9-2020

The pizza calculator takes in the amount of People and the amount of Pizza you and returns the amount of Pizza slices that each person will get. I created this because I have seen people actually fight over slices, if everyone ate their fair share of pizza, then no one would fight about it.
